#### \390. Elimination Game

```java
/* recursive. Consider a cycle of left -> right -> left.
Each cycle is essentially resetting the current sequence
to a smaller consequtive sequence, and multiply by 4. 
There are two cases when go from right in a cycle: 
1) start even number is divisible by 4: the multiplyer is 4x - 2;
2) start even number not divisible by 4: the multiplyer is 4x.*/
class Solution {
    public int lastRemaining(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        if (n <= 5) return 2;
        int multi = 0;
        if (n % 4 <= 1) return lastRemaining(n / 4) * 4 - 2;
        else return lastRemaining(n / 4) * 4;
